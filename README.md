# Redux-Crud

- This is a simple Redux-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React and Redux. The project allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a set of data, which is fetched from a mock API using json-server and axios. The UI is styled with Bootstrap and every operation is managed using Redux for state management.

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: State management library for React.
- React-Redux: Official bindings to use Redux with React.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
- Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive and styled components.
- JSON-Server: A fake REST API server used to simulate data storage.
- UUID: Library to generate unique identifiers for data objects.

## Features

- Create: Add a new item to the list.
- Read: View the list of all items.
- Update: Edit an existing item in the list.
- Delete: Remove an item from the list.
- Uses Axios to fetch data from the API and send updates.
- State is managed using Redux to handle global state changes for the list.
